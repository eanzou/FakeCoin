# FakeCoin

Design an algorithm of complexity Î˜(1) to distinguish whether the fake coin is lighter or heavier than the others. 

1. Assume that the total number of coins from 12 to 13 identical-looking.
2. Two-pan balance scale with no weights. 
3. Only one of the coins is a fake, 
4. You do not know whether it is lighter or heavier than the genuine coins. 
5. All genuine coins weight the same.
